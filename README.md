# kindPath

Every to-do list has a common feature: a strict push for the user to always complete the list, whether or not they
are physically or even mentally capable of completing the tasks on an equal day-to-day basis.  Enter kindPath, the
kinder to-do list app.  Just input the date and your energy level (choose between low and normal--upgrades to come
soon!) and kindPath will sort your to-do items based on an algorithm, showing only the most managable, or the most
crucial, tasks for you to complete.
